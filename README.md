# Smart-Parking-IOT-project
Parking like any other thing in our life has a problem that has a small solution and as the number of people in one area increases the usage of cars and parking spots will also increase and that will cause congestion traffic and will only delay you from finding a parking spot, this project offers the use of IR sensors, Arduino and Android application (IOT) to solve this issue with some specific algorithms to show you all the available parking spots in that area.
